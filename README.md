# System Design Notes 🚀

This repository contains **structured system design notes and end-to-end system
designs**, covering scalability, distributed systems, and real-world architecture
patterns.

It is designed for:
- System design interviews (Big Tech, FinTech, Backend roles)
- Understanding large-scale distributed systems
- Serving as a long-term reference for backend and infrastructure concepts

## 🎯 How to Use This Repository

- **Beginners**: Start with the `concepts/` folder in order (01 → 07)
- **Interview Prep**: Pick any system in `systems/` and practice explaining:
  - Requirements
  - High-level architecture
  - Data flow
  - Trade-offs
- **Reference**: Use individual files as quick refreshers before interviews

---

## 🧪 Interview Focus Areas

These notes emphasize:
- Scalability and fault tolerance
- Trade-offs and design decisions
- Read-heavy vs write-heavy systems
- Caching, queues, and async processing
- Consistency vs availability
- Real-world production constraints

---

## 📈 Status

✅ Core concepts complete  
✅ High-value system designs complete  
🛠️ Open to future enhancements (diagrams, follow-ups, optimizations)

---

## 📌 Future Improvements (Optional)

- Add architecture diagrams to `/diagrams`
- Add interviewer follow-up questions per system
- Add trade-off comparison summaries
- Add capacity estimation walkthroughs
